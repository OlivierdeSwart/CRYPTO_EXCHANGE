## Project Composition:
Our Decentralized Crypto Exchange is a comprehensive platform comprising both front-end and back-end components, meticulously deployed across two key test networks: Mumbai and Sepolia.

## Core Technology - Smart Contracts:
At the heart of our exchange are two pivotal smart contracts:

- Token.sol: This contract has been deployed thrice to forge three distinct cryptocurrencies: Dapp, mEth, and mDai. These tokens are the primary assets available for exchange.
- Exchange.sol: Facilitating the core exchange functionality, this contract empowers users to trade the aforementioned cryptocurrencies seamlessly.

## Features at a Glance:
Our exchange platform is rich with features designed to enhance user experience:

- Market & Token Pair Selection: Users can select from various markets and token trading pairs.
- Network Selection: Flexibility to choose between the Mumbai and Sepolia networks.
- Balance Management: Comprehensive overview of balances for trading pairs with options to deposit or withdraw funds.
- Order Management: Users can create, view, and manage their trading orders.
- Trading History Visualization: A candlestick chart provides a graphical representation of trading activities.
- User Orders & Trades Overview: A detailed look into the user's own orders and the trades executed across the platform.
- Order Book: A real-time order book displaying the depth of market for selected trading pairs.
